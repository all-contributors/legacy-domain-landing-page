# This project has moved!
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

This project merged with the main [all-contributors repository](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors)
and the site is now located at [allcontributors.org](https://allcontributors.org)

This is just a placeholder to redirect legacy traffic from all-contributors.js.org to [allcontributors.org](allcontributors.org).

This was undertaken as part of issue [all-contributors#150](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors/issues/150)
