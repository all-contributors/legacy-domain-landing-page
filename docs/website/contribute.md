## Editing Content

> **Pro Tip**: Every page has an _Edit_ button up the top, clicking this will take you straight to the GitHub source code for that page

Once on a file, click the 'pencil' icon to [easily edit the file inline](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/)
<div align="center">
    <img src="../assets/edit-this-page.png" alt="Example on how to edit a page" width="800px" />
</div>
