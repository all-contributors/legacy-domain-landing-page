This is a specification for recognizing contributors to an open source project in a way that rewards each and every contribution, not just code.

The basic idea is this:

> Use the project README (or other prominent public documentation page in the project) to recognize the contributions of members of the project community.

People are giving of themselves and their free time to contribute to open source projects in so many ways. It can be a real
time sink sometimes and so they should be praised for all their contributions (code or not).

## Tools for updating your all-contributors table

If you find maintaining the list of contributors tedious, say hello to the [@all-contributors bot ðŸ¤–](/docs/github-bot)

If you prefer command line tools, there is also the [all-contributors CLI tool](/docs/cli)
