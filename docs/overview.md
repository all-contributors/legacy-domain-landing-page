This is a specification for recognizing contributors to an open source project in a way that rewards each and every contribution, not just code.

The basic idea is this:

> Use the project README (or other prominent public documentation page in the project) to recognize the contributions of members of the project community.

People are giving of themselves and their free time to contribute to open source projects in so many ways. It can be a real
time sink sometimes and so they should be praised for all their contributions (code or not).

## The All Contributors Table
A project using the all-contributors spec table:
