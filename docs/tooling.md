> There is [now a GitHub Bot](/docs/bot/overview) for automating the maintenance of your contributors table âœ¨<br />Say goodbye to command line tool dependencies and hello to the [@all-contributors bot ðŸ¤–](/docs/bot/overview)


## The Problem
You want to implement the [All Contributors spec](/docs/specification), but don't want to maintain the table by hand

## The solution
Say hello to the [@all-contributors bot ðŸ¤–](/docs/bot/overview) on GitHub to automate the process


If you prefer command line tools, there is also the [all-contributors CLI tool](/docs/cli/overview)
