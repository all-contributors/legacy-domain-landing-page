## The Problem
You want to implement the [All Contributors spec](/docs/specification), but don't want to maintain the table by hand

## The solution
Say hello to the [@all-contributors bot ðŸ¤–](/docs/bot/overview)to automate the process on your GitHub repository

If you prefer command line tools, or don't host your project on GitHub, there is also the [all-contributors CLI tool](/docs/cli/overview)
